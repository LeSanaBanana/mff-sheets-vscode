h||Alliance Battle Focused

p||twice||ctp_rage||Rage
pt||
t||Rage is always the ideal choice for Alliance Battle, even if the character is perfectly proc-friendly.
t||Reforge: Helps, but not necessary. Can add about 1m score depending on the character, mostly for pushing higher scores. It's recommended to have a regular Rage on everyone you need for ABX/L before reforging.

h||World Boss Legend Focused

p||twice||ctp_energy||Energy
pt||
t||Energy is good for proc-friendly characters who do not have innate Chain Hit Damage. Note that some characters gain Chain Hit Damage later on (e.g. on Tier-4 Striker Skill) which may change the recommendation.
t||Reforge: Helps, but not necessary. As you start pushing WBL to higher stages, the added Pierce will help a lot. 

p||twice||ctp_destruction||Destruction
pt||
t||Destruction is good for proc-friendly characters who do have innate Chain Hit Damage. 
t||Reforge: Absolutely necessary.

p||twice||ctp_judgement||Judgement
pt||
t||Judgement only works for characters who deal Elemental Damage, and ideally ones that are not proc-friendly. Performs better than a Rage in most cases.
t||Due to diminishing returns on Elemental buffs, it may be less effective on characters with substantial Elemental buffs natively.
t||Reforge: Helps, but not necessary. Basically just makes it deal a bit more damage. There are not many characters who can make good use of Judgement, so it is probably okay to Reforge.

p||twice||ctp_rage||Rage
pt||
t||Rage is good for WBL characters who are completely not proc-friendly, and not Elemental (thus unable to use Judgement). 
t||Such characters are unideal in most cases, but there are some exceptions that are great in WBL with a Rage.
t||Reforge: Helps, but not necessary, especially for WBL purposes.

h||Giant Boss Raid

p||twice||ctp_rage||Rage
pt||
t||Similar to 

h||Dispatch Missions / Zombie Survival

t||The chaotic nature of these modes makes a persistent proc ideal. Especially if running multiple dealers.
